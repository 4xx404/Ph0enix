# Ph0enix  
A search tool for finding usernames across a variety of sites.  
  
# How it works?  
The tool uses a config file which holds a list of urls. For every url inside the list, the tool will find the sites where the username matches.  

# Usage  
```
git clone https://github.com/4xx404/Ph0enix.git
cd Ph0enix
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ph0enix.py
```
  
# Adding URL's  
Open **Config.py** which can be found in the **Core/** directory and add the new URL with the following format:  
```
site:url  
example:https://www.example.com/[USER]
example:https://[USER].example.com/
```
  
Be sure to put [USER] part inside the url to make the tool work properly.  

# Example  
```
 .------..------..------..------..------..------..------..------..------.

 [?] Matches may not always be specific to the user you are looking for.
